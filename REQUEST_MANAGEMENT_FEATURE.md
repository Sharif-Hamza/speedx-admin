# Support & Data Request Management Feature

## Overview
Admins can now mark support requests and data requests as completed. Once marked as completed, requests are automatically hidden from the main view (but remain in the database) to prevent the lists from becoming cluttered.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Support Requests Management
**Location:** Admin Dashboard → Support Requests

#### New Functionality:
- ✅ **Mark as Completed** button in request detail modal
- ✅ **Hide Completed** checkbox to toggle visibility of completed requests
- ✅ Completed requests change status to `resolved`
- ✅ Timestamp automatically set when marked as completed (`resolved_at`)
- ✅ Visual indicators for completed requests
- ✅ Loading state while updating

#### How It Works:
1. Admin opens a support request detail modal
2. If not already resolved, a green "Mark as Completed" button appears
3. Click the button to mark as completed
4. Request status changes to `resolved` and disappears from list (if "Hide Completed" is enabled)
5. Data is preserved in database - never deleted

### 2. Data Requests Management
**Location:** Admin Dashboard → Data Requests

#### New Functionality:
- ✅ **Mark as Completed** button in request detail modal
- ✅ **Hide Completed** checkbox to toggle visibility of completed requests
- ✅ Completed requests change status to `completed`
- ✅ Timestamp automatically set when marked as completed (`processed_at`)
- ✅ Visual indicators for completed/rejected requests
- ✅ Loading state while updating

#### How It Works:
1. Admin opens a data request detail modal
2. If not already completed or rejected, a green "Mark as Completed" button appears
3. Click the button to mark as completed
4. Request status changes to `completed` and disappears from list (if "Hide Completed" is enabled)
5. Data is preserved in database - never deleted

## Database Changes

### Support Requests
When marked as completed:
- `status` → `'resolved'`
- `resolved_at` → current timestamp

### Data Requests
When marked as completed:
- `status` → `'completed'`
- `processed_at` → current timestamp

## User Interface

### Hide Completed Toggle
- **Location:** Top right of each request management page
- **Default State:** Enabled (completed requests are hidden)
- **Behavior:** 
  - When enabled: Hides all completed/resolved requests from the table
  - When disabled: Shows all requests including completed ones
- **Persists:** Only during current session (resets on page refresh)

### Status Indicators
- **Support Requests:**
  - New: Blue badge
  - In Progress: Yellow badge
  - Resolved: Green badge

- **Data Requests:**
  - Pending: Blue badge
  - Processing: Yellow badge
  - Completed: Green badge
  - Rejected: Red badge

### Action Button
- **Color:** Green (indicates positive action)
- **Icon:** Checkmark
- **States:**
  - Normal: "Mark as Completed"
  - Loading: Spinner + "Updating..." / "Processing..."
  - Disabled: Grayed out when already completed

## Benefits

1. **Clean Interface:** Completed requests don't clutter the dashboard
2. **Data Preservation:** Nothing is deleted - just hidden from view
3. **Easy Toggle:** Can view completed requests anytime by unchecking "Hide Completed"
4. **Audit Trail:** Timestamps recorded for when requests were completed
5. **Visual Feedback:** Clear indicators of request status
6. **Prevents Overload:** Lists remain manageable as requests are completed

## Admin Workflow

### Processing a Support Request:
1. View request in Support Requests tab
2. Click "View Details" to open modal
3. Read the request details
4. Click email to respond to user
5. After resolving the issue, click "Mark as Completed"
6. Request is automatically hidden from main list
7. Continue with next request

### Processing a Data Request:
1. View request in Data Requests tab
2. Click "View Details" to open modal
3. Read the request type (Export or Delete)
4. Follow processing guidelines shown in modal
5. Complete the data export/deletion
6. Contact user via email
7. Click "Mark as Completed"
8. Request is automatically hidden from main list

## Technical Details

### State Management
- `hideCompleted`: Boolean state controlling visibility filter
- `updating`: Boolean state for loading indicator during updates
- `selectedRequest`: Currently viewed request in modal

### Supabase Updates
Both components use Supabase client to update records:
```typescript
await supabase
  .from('support_requests') // or 'data_requests'
  .update({ 
    status: 'resolved', // or 'completed'
    resolved_at: new Date().toISOString() // or processed_at
  })
  .eq('id', requestId)
```

### Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks around database operations
- Alert notifications for success/failure
- Console logging of errors
- Graceful fallback if update fails

## Testing Checklist
